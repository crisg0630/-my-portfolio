                       <div id="about">
                    <p>I've been interested in coding since my sophomore year of high school. 
                        The following two years consisted of me creating, promoting, and gathering funding for coding and robotics clubs at my high school. I built on this experience during my freshman year of college when 
                        I co-founded a program that helps teach high school students how to code. This program took place at the high school that I graduated from, John Henry High School, in Richmond, California.</p>

                        <p>I would like to focus on helping and creating these opportunities for others, specifically in my hometown of Richmond, California. When I attended schools in Richmond, I was never introduced to any STEM opportunities 
                            until I was in the 10th grade. That opportunity was a coding program that only took place at my high school during my sophomore year but that was more than enough time to realize that coding was something I was really passionate about. After finding out that
                             the program would not be returning the following year due to low attendance I created a coding club at my high school. After promoting it around the school, I was able to get enough recurrent members to have it take place. The following year I created a
                              robotics club/team in which I and other students were able to compete against other high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area in a robotics competition that was hosted by UC Berkeley's Pioneers in Engineering organization. 
                            We went from not knowing anything about building robots to being able to create a fully functional autonomous robot in a matter of a few weeks and ended up being finishing 6th out of 21 high schools in the qualifying rounds. I ended up winning the Pioneers in Engineering scholarship as well.</p>
                        
                            <p>These encounters have fueled my passion for coding and I continuously would like to partake in more experiences that can increase my knowledge.</p>
